## V3 to V4
Mapping of feature names is [here](v3_to_v4_feature_mapping.csv). This mapping is based on analysis of round 311 live data.

Correlation is high for most of the 1050 features, however there are about 20-30 with correlation below 0.9. If these features have high importance in your model then it is less likely you can maintain performance by simply mapping to the new features.

## V2 to V3
Mapping of feature names is [here](v2_to_v3_feature_mapping.csv).

Mapping of era numbers is [here](v2_to_v3_era_mapping.csv).
